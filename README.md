# Writing-to-a-Text-File
I wanted to write to a friendâ€™s Facebook wall a sentence that ended in an obscene amount of exclamation marks. I also wanted to practice outputting to a text file. Instead of copying over and over again a collection of exclamation marks, I thought writing a function that would multiply any string as many times as I wanted and output it to a text file would be fun. Sure enough, I really enjoyed this, lol!
