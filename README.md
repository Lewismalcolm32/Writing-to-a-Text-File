# Writing-to-a-Text-File
I wanted to write to a friends Facebook wall a sentence that ended in an obscene amount of exclamation marks. Instead of copying over and over again, I wrote a function that would multiply any string as many times as I wanted, and output it to a text file. This was a lot of fun, lol.
